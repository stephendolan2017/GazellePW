<Heading1 id="content">Golden Rules</Heading1>

Exactly what it says on the tin. These are the golden rules you absolutely must follow. Non-compliance could jeopardise your account.

<Heading2 id="1.1">1.1. One account per person, per lifetime</Heading2>

Users are allowed one account per lifetime. If your account is disabled, contact staff in <a href={props.TG_DISBALE_CHANNEL}>the Discord server</a> or [Staff PM](/staffpm.php). Never make another account, you will be disabled without question.

<Heading2 id="1.2">1.2. Do not trade, sell, give away, or offer accounts</Heading2>

If you no longer wish to use your account, send a [Staff PM](/staffpm.php) and request that your account be disabled.

<Heading2 id="1.3">1.3. Do not share accounts</Heading2>

Accounts are for personal use only. Granting access to your account in any way (e.g., shared login details, external programs) is prohibited. [Invite](/wiki.php?action=article&name=invite) friends or direct them to our <a href={props.TG_GROUP}>Discord server</a>.

<Heading2 id="2.1">2.1. Do not invite bad users</Heading2>

You are responsible for your invitees. You will not be punished if your invitees fail to maintain required share ratios, but invitees who break golden rules or fail to follow the <a href="http://coldplayarchive.com/rules.php?p=upload">upload rules</a> consistently will place your invite privileges and account at risk.

<Heading2 id="2.2">2.2. Do not trade, sell, publicly give away, or publicly offer invites</Heading2>

Only invite people you know and trust. Do not offer invites via other trackers, forums, social media, or other public locations, responding to public invite requests is prohibited. Exception: Staff-designated recruiters may offer invites in approved locations. Be careful not get posts indexed by search engine.

<Heading2 id="2.3">2.3. Do not reveal site information in public</Heading2>

Do not mention Coldplay Archive in any public area, and do not reveal our site url or tracker url. This is a private tracker for a reason!

<Heading2 id="3.1">3.1. Do not engage in ratio manipulation</Heading2>

Transferring buffer—or increasing your buffer—through unintended uses of the BitTorrent protocol or site features (e.g., [request abuse](rules.php?p=requests")) constitutes ratio manipulation. When in doubt, send a [Staff PM](staffpm.php") asking for more information.

<Heading2 id="3.2">3.2. Do not report incorrect data to the tracker (i.e., cheating)</Heading2>

Reporting incorrect data to the tracker constitutes cheating, whether it is accomplished through the use of a modified "cheat client" or through manipulation of an approved client.

<Heading2 id="3.3">3.3. Do not modify Coldplay Archive .torrent files</Heading2>

Embedding non-Coldplay Archive announce URLs in Coldplay Archive .torrents is prohibited. Doing so causes false data to be reported and will be interpreted as cheating. This applies to standalone .torrent files and .torrent files that have been loaded into a client.

<Heading2 id="3.4">3.4. Do not share .torrent files or your passkey</Heading2>

Embedded in each Coldplay Archive .torrent file is an announce URL containing your personal passkey. Passkeys enable users to report stats to the tracker.

<Heading2 id="4.1">4.1. Follow all upload rules meticulously</Heading2>

After all, this is an archive. Each upload must follow the <a href="http://coldplayarchive.com/rules.php?p=upload">upload rules</a>. Only direct captures are allowed; no screen-recording. Re-encodes are not allowed and this must be proven with a detailed lineage report. Failure to do so will result in the torrent being deleted and a warning put on your account. Repeat offenders will be banned.
