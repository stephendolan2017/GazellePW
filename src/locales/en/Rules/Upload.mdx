Before you upload anything, if you are still unsure of what a rule means, PLEASE ask your questions on <a href={props.TG_DISBALE_CHANNEL}>the Discord server</a> or send a [Staff PM](staffpm.php).

<Heading2 id="1">1. Upload What</Heading2>

<Heading4 id="1.1.5">1.1.5. **Instrumental:** Preferably official instrumentals only. Source is usually hard to pin down on these so it's sometimes hard to verify. Send a [Staff PM](staffpm.php) if you are unsure.</Heading4>
